❄️ About Me:
<br>Hey there! I'm Thisaru — a Software Engineering graduate with a BSc (Hons) in Software Engineering from Plymouth University. I'm passionate about creating web applications and continuously expanding my knowledge in tech. I enjoy working with JavaScript and React, and I’m currently diving into the world of Python.<br><br>- 🌱 Currently learning: Python and its applications in automation and data handling  <br>- 📚 Always exploring: New tools, clean code practices, and building useful projects  <br>- 💬 Ask me about: Web development, UI/UX tips, or just say hi!  <br>- 🎯 Goals: Contribute to open-source and become a better problem-solver  <br>- ⚡ Fun fact: Half of my time coding is just figuring out what I named that variable.<br>
